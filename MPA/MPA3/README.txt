MPA 3 (Twisted Snakes and Ladders) Assignment

Implement the famous 10x10 snakes and ladders game.  The cells are numbered from 1 to 100 (bottom left is cell 1, cell 2 to its right, all the way until cell 10 - the bottom right cell. Cell 11 is on top of cell 10). Check out the image below. There should 3 snakes and 3 ladders positioned. There can be a maximum of 4 players. Each turn, the player rolls a die and moves accordingly. When the player lands on the head of a snake, the player is sent back to the tail of the snake. When the player lands on the base of a ladder, it goes up the ladder. The player the reaches cell 100 first wins the game.

Here comes the twist. The snakes and the ladders randomly change locations for every turn.  When this implemented, make sure the tail of a snake doesn't go beyond the board and the top of the ladder does not go beyond the board as well.

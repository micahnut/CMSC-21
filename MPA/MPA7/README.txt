MPA 7 (Polynomial Calculator) Assignment

This is a polynomial calculator machine problem on addition, subtraction and multiplication of polynomial expressions

Input:

The input should be read from a file. The first line is a number, say t. The number t represents the number of pairs of strings that will follow. The pairs of strings represents two polynomial expressions where each term is of the form ax^b.  a may be any integer and b may be any non-negative integer.

Output:

For each test case, there should be 3 outputs.  The first output is for addition, the second for subtraction and the third for the multiplication.

The filename of the input file is mpa7.in.  The output should be displayed in the console.

Sample:

Input:

2
4x
7x^2-9x+5x^3
20
x^4+5x^2-10

Output (Console):

Test Case 1:
5x^3+7x^2-5x
-5x^3-7x^2+13x
20x^4+28x^3-36x^2
Test Case 2:
x^4+5x^2+10
-x^4-5x^2+30
20x^4+100x^2-200
